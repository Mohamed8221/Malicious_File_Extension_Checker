# Malicious File Extension Checker

## Introduction
This document explains the C++ code implementation of a Malicious File Extension Checker. The program identifies potentially harmful files based on their extensions by comparing them against a predefined list of malicious extensions. These extensions are loaded from an external file.

## 1. File Extension Extraction
The function `getFileExtension` is responsible for extracting the file extension from a given filename. It uses the `find_last_of` method to locate the last occurrence of a dot (`.`), which typically separates the filename from its extension. The function returns the substring after the last dot as the file extension. If no dot is found, an empty string is returned.

### Function: getFileExtension
```cpp
std::string getFileExtension(const std::string& filename) {
    size_t dotPos = filename.find_last_of('.');
    if (dotPos == std::string::npos) {
        return ""; // No extension found
    }
    return filename.substr(dotPos + 1);
}
```

## 2. Checking for Malicious Extensions
The function `isMaliciousExtension` takes the filename and the set of malicious extensions as input. It calls the `getFileExtension` function to extract the extension and converts it to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. The function then checks if the extracted extension is present in the unordered set of malicious extensions. If a match is found, the function returns true, indicating that the file has a malicious extension.

### Function: isMaliciousExtension
```cpp
bool isMaliciousExtension(const std::string& filename, const std::unordered_set<std::string>& maliciousExtensions) {
    std::string extension = getFileExtension(filename);
    std::transform(extension.begin(), extension.end(), extension.begin(), ::tolower); // Convert to lowercase
    return maliciousExtensions.find(extension) != maliciousExtensions.end();
}
```

## 3. Loading Malicious Extensions from File
The `loadMaliciousExtensions` function reads a list of malicious file extensions from an external file. Each line of the file contains a single extension. It removes any leading or trailing whitespace and converts the extensions to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparisons. The function inserts each valid extension into the unordered set of malicious extensions. If the file cannot be opened, the function returns false and an error message is printed.

### Function: loadMaliciousExtensions
```cpp
bool loadMaliciousExtensions(const std::string& filepath, std::unordered_set<std::string>& maliciousExtensions) {
    std::ifstream infile(filepath);
    if (!infile.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Could not open file " << filepath << std::endl;
        return false;
    }
    std::string extension;
    while (std::getline(infile, extension)) {
        extension.erase(0, extension.find_first_not_of(" \t\n\r")); // Trim leading whitespace
        extension.erase(extension.find_last_not_of(" \t\n\r") + 1); // Trim trailing whitespace
        std::transform(extension.begin(), extension.end(), extension.begin(), ::tolower);
        if (!extension.empty()) {
            maliciousExtensions.insert(extension);
        }
    }
    infile.close();
    return true;
}
```

## 4. Data Structures Explanation
In this program, the following data structures are used:

### a) std::unordered_set
The `std::unordered_set` is used to store the list of known malicious file extensions. This container provides an efficient way to store and look up unique values, with average time complexity of O(1) for both insertions and lookups. Since the program checks whether a file extension exists in the list of malicious extensions, using `std::unordered_set` ensures fast lookups, making it ideal for this application.

### b) std::string
The `std::string` is used throughout the program to handle file names and extensions. It provides a flexible way to manipulate strings, such as extracting substrings (for file extensions), converting to lowercase, and removing whitespace. The C++ Standard Library's `std::string` class handles dynamic memory management, ensuring safe and efficient operations when dealing with string data.

### c) std::ifstream
`std::ifstream` is used to handle input file operations. It reads the list of malicious file extensions from an external file and processes each line to extract the extension. The `std::ifstream` class provides functions like `is_open` to check if the file was successfully opened and `getline` to read each line from the file.

## 5. Main Function
The `main` function first calls `loadMaliciousExtensions` to populate the unordered set with malicious extensions from the external file. If the file fails to open, the program exits with an error message. After successfully loading the extensions, the program checks several example file names for malicious extensions using the `isMaliciousExtension` function. The result is printed to the console.

### Function: main
```cpp
int main() {
    std::unordered_set<std::string> maliciousExtensions;
    std::string extensionsFile = "malicious_extensions.txt";
    if (!loadMaliciousExtensions(extensionsFile, maliciousExtensions)) {
        return 1; // Exit if the file could not be opened
    }
    std::string files[] = {"file1.exe", "document.txt", "script.js", "image.jpeg", "archive.rar", "virus.scr"};
    for (const auto& file : files) {
        if (isMaliciousExtension(file, maliciousExtensions)) {
            std::cout << file << " has a malicious file extension!" << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cout << file << " is safe." << std::endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## 6. Common Malicious File Extensions
Below is a list of common file extensions that are considered potentially malicious, along with explanations of why they are dangerous.

1. **.exe (Executable File)**
   - **Reason**: .exe files are the standard extension for executable files on Windows. These can run arbitrary code and are often used to install programs. A malicious .exe could install malware, ransomware, or spyware without the user's knowledge.

2. **.bat (Batch File)**
   - **Reason**: Batch files contain a series of commands that are executed in the Windows command prompt. Malicious .bat files can execute harmful system commands, delete files, alter configurations, or download malicious software.

3. **.cmd (Command Script)**
   - **Reason**: Similar to .bat files, .cmd files contain command scripts that can be executed by the Windows command line. Malicious .cmd files can execute harmful system commands and scripts that compromise the security of the machine.

4. **.scr (Screensaver File)**
   - **Reason**: While .scr files are typically used for screensavers, they are executable files. Malicious screensavers can contain harmful code and are often used in phishing attacks to trick users into running them.

5. **.js (JavaScript File)**
   - **Reason**: JavaScript files are often used in web development, but .js files can also be used to execute code in a local or browser environment. Malicious JavaScript files can steal sensitive information, hijack browsers, or download malware.

6. **.vbs (VBScript File)**
   - **Reason**: VBScript files are scripts written in Visual Basic Scripting Edition, which can automate tasks or run scripts in Windows environments. Malicious .vbs files can run harmful commands, modify system files, or download malware.

7. **.sh (Shell Script)**
   - **Reason**: Shell scripts are used in Unix-based systems to execute commands in the shell. A malicious .sh file can execute commands that manipulate system configurations, delete files, or perform unwanted operations without the user's permission.

8. **.com (Command File)**
   - **Reason**: .com files are older types of executable files similar to .exe. They can be used to execute code and perform malicious actions such as installing malware, modifying system files, or hijacking system processes.

9. **.msi (Microsoft Installer Package)**
   - **Reason**: .msi files are used to install applications in Windows. Malicious .msi files can be used to install harmful software or unwanted programs under the guise of legitimate software.

10. **.dll (Dynamic Link Library)**
    - **Reason**: DLL files contain code that can be used by other programs. Malicious .dll files can be loaded by legitimate software to run harmful code, steal data, or damage system files.

11. **.pif (Program Information File)**
    - **Reason**: Originally used to provide information to DOS applications, .pif files can also be used to execute code. Malicious .pif files can run harmful programs or scripts, making them a potential security threat.

## 7. The Output
1. Files created with different extensions in the same directory.
2. Content of `malicious_extensions.txt`.
3. The output of all code.
